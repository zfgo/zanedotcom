    As mentioned in the <a href="./about_me.html">about me</a> page, some things I
    enjoy are riding my bike, taking photos, reading (mostly science fiction and 
    fantasy), games (board, video, rpg), urbanism, Formula 1, and sailing.

    I ride my bike to get exercise, vitamin D, and fresh air. It makes me feel alive. 
    Right now, my main bicycle is a "commuter bike" that I built up during August 
    of 2023. The frameset is a 
    <a href="https://surlybikes.com/bikes/midnight_special">Surly Midnight Special</a> 
    with mostly Shimano components. Coming from Oregon, you gotta protect from the rain,
    so I have it set up with a nice pair of <a href="https://sks-us.com/collections/bluemels">SKS Bluemels Fenders</a>
    with some <a href="https://ass-savers.com/collections/all/products/brotector-reflective-red-mudflap">mudflap extensions</a>
    to keep the spray off.

    I'm not sure how I really got into photography, but it probably came from my dad.
    I bought a film camera (a Minolta SR-T 101) off of craigslist for myself in 2023, but didn't really
    start to use it until I moved to Atlanta in 2024. It has been a lot of fun, 
    not only learning about how film works, but also going on "missions" to take 
    photos has made me look at my surroundings in new ways.

    <p>
    Photos will eventually be posted to this website.

    I am currently (as of 2024-12-08) reading <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> by
    Alexander Dumas and <em>Walkable City</em> by Jeff Speck. I know I sad that I 
    normally read sci-fi and fantasy, but by no means do I shoehorn myself into those
    genres. In fact, I have recently been trying to read more stuff outside of those genres. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Books that I have (somewhat) recently read and enjoyed include, but are not limited to, <em>Project 
    Hail Mary</em> by Andy Weir, <em>Hyperion</em> and <em>The Fall of Hyperion</em> by Dan
    Simmons, <em>The Stormlight Archive</em> by Brandon Sanderson (book 5 will be read once I am 
    done with my current books), and the <em>Aubrey-Maturin</em> novels by Patrick O'Brian (I have read
    the first 7).
    </p>

    Games are probably one of the greatest things humans have ever created, and they are definitely
    (in my opinion) one of the best ways to pass time when you are with friends. My
    favorite boardgames are Monopoly, Nuclear War, Munchkin, and Boggle. I also enjoy 
    video games, mainly sticking to a small selection. That selection is currently Factorio,
    Red Dead Redemption 2, Grand Theft Auto V, Minecraft, Portal 2, and Stellaris. Factorio is by far
    my favorite game of all time. As of 2024-12-08 I have 644 hours played, and I would not be surprised
    if that number doubles in the next few years. I also really enjoy Dungeons and Dragons, 
    and my friends and I have two ongoing campaigns that we are currently playing.

    Recently, I have been getting into urbanism, especially since I have lived in Atlanta. 
    The fact that this city is built around the assumption that everyone owns a personal car
    slightly infuriates me. I firmly believe that cities should be built for <em>people</em>
    and not cars. If you want to know more about this I highly encourage you read
    <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Walkable-City-Tenth-Anniversary-Downtown/dp/1250857988">Walkable City</a></em>
    by Jeff Speck.

    I can not tell you why I like Formula 1 aside from the fact that it is cool
    to see cars going fast. I started watching halfway through the 2020 season 
    after hearing about how dominant Lewis Hamilton was, and I have been routing
    for him ever since. Aside from the "cars going fast" aspect, it is really 
    fascinating learning about the engineering that is put into these cars, and 
    the technological advancements that the engineers have created.

    My dad owns a sailboat (a small dinghy called a Lido 14), and every Wednesday during 
    the springs and summers of 2022 and 2024, we would go out to our local reservoir for 
    some racing against the other Lidos that are in the fleet. Sailing is such a beautiful
    thing: the fact that you are at the whim of the wind, but also can go anywhere you want
    so long as the wind is blowing and there is water before your bow is magical. I follow 
    some sailboat racing as well, mostly the Vendee Globe.

    I was a computer science major in college, so of course I have opinions about software.
    I won't stray into any sort of debate about AI, but I will say that 
    <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> is great, and <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>
    is perhaps one of the most amazing things ever invented.

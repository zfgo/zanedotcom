    <p>I grew up in the Eugene, Oregon. I went the university there as well, 
    the University of Oregon, where I got a Bachelor of Science in Computer 
    Science and Economics, and a minor in Mathematics.

    I moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in early 2024 for work. Living in Atlanta has 
    been lovely, and I especially enjoy the warm weather. However, I am disappointed in
    how car dependent the city is, and when I am looking for places 
    to move in the future, alternative transit (bike, bus, train, walk) will
    be something that I will take more into consideration.
    </p>

    <p>
    I enjoy riding my bike, taking photos, reading (mostly science fiction and 
    fantasy), games (board, video, rpg), urbanism, Formula 1, and sailing.
